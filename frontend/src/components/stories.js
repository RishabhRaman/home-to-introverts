But then I met Sarah, who noticed my discomfort and invited me to sit with her at lunch. That small act of kindness made all the difference. By the end of the day, I felt a little less alone in this new place.",

But when the discussion turned to a topic I was passionate about, I found the courage to speak. My voice was soft, but my words were clear. To my surprise, the room fell silent, and everyone listened. That day I learned that being introverted doesn't mean being silent forever.",
